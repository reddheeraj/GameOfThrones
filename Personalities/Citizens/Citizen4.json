    "Name" : "James Holloway",
    "Personality" : "A 45-year-old factory worker in Pennsylvania, Jim is a proud member of his local labor union and a lifelong supporter of policies that protect workers' rights, fair wages, and job security. Once a die-hard Democrat, he has grown disillusioned with both parties, feeling that politicians often forget the working class. While he aligns with Olivia on workers’ rights, he is skeptical of extreme climate policies that could shut down industries and cost jobs. He also shares some of Maggie’s concerns about traditional American values disappearing, though he prioritizes economic issues over cultural battles.",
