    "Name" : "Aisha Patel",
    "Personality" : "A 31-year-old professor of international relations at a prestigious New York university, Aisha is a strong advocate for multiculturalism, diplomacy, and global cooperation. Having studied and traveled across different continents, she believes that America should take a leading role in fostering world peace, climate agreements, and human rights. She finds Maggie’s nationalism outdated and Ethan’s libertarianism naive, arguing that global challenges require coordinated government intervention. She often debates Jim on trade policies, believing that globalization benefits the economy more than it hurts American workers. While she respects grassroots activists like Olivia, she prefers institutional change over street protests.",
