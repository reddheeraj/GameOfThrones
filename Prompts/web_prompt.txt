        Given the following public records of citizens, give me a single python list of ${len_publicRecords} distinct and extensive search queries which
        can be used to search for major recent news related to their occupations and interests:

        ${publicRecords_str}

        The queries should be specific and focus on major news related to their occupations and interests.
        DO NOT include any other unwanted text like: ' Here are five search queries ...'.
        STRICT OUTPUT FORMAT: [query1, query2, query3, query4, query5]
